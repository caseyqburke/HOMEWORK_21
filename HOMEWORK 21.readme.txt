HOMEWORK 21
First thing I did was take use the starter codes and took crowd sale code and joined with  puppercoin crowdsale code. 
I changed the decibels parameter to 18.
Then I lead the original supply parameter alone. 
Then I need to set up the parameters with the specifications from the homework instructions.
After I set up the parameters, I compiled then deloyed the contracts.
After that I was able to get a token address and a sale address.
The token address is of the first contract. 
I took that then pasted that address into “At Address” 
Went back up to chose puppercoin to deploy the “At Address”
Then I clicked on token sale address and copied that
Then I put token sale address and put that in to “address” then went and chose puppercoin sale to deloy the contract and review the successful transaction.
